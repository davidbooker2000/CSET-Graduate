    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Norfolk State University Digital Forensics institute was  started with funds from the DoD IASP 2010 Cybersecurity Capacity building  grant. These modest funds provided Digital Forensics hardware and software to  the tune of $40,000 and development of Digital Forensic courses and course  modules.</p>
     <p> Currently the center is managed by members of the IA-REDI  committee, however it expected in the future that the Digital Forensics  institute will function as an autonomous sub center of IA-REDI.</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3)  is proposing starting in 2012 a National Centers of  Digital Forensics Academic Excellence Program <a href="http://www.dc3.mil/cdfae/">http://www.dc3.mil/cdfae/</a>    Applications will commence in the  latter part of 2012 and the Norfolk State University Digital Foorensics  institute will be submitting an application to be designated as a National  Center of Digital Forensics Academic Excellence. Our progress based on the  draft criteria can be charted at this site. </p>

    <h3>Progress towards a National Center of Digital  Forensics  Excellence</h3>
      <h3>Center director(s)</h3>
    <p>Identify by name  full-time employee or employees, either faculty or member of the administration working in Digital Forensics, with overall  responsibility for the Digital Forensics Instructional Program. Provide  biographies to substantiate depth and length of faculty expertise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>NSU faculty</h3>
      <br />
    <p> Identify by name additional Digital Forensics faculty members, as defined in Appendix C: Definitions and Terms, working full- or part-time  teaching Digital Forensics courses within the department that sponsors the  Digital Forensics programs</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Shared faculty</h3>
    <p>Identify by name  shared faculty (e.g., intra- or inter-departmental or other four-year graduate university, industry expert, etc.) and adjunct/part-time faculty (e.g., professor teaching one or two Digital Forensics courses per semester or teaching Digital Forensics in existing  courses.)</p>

    <p>Evidence Digital Forensics is taught as modules in existing courses and that  non-technical/non-Digital Forensics students are being introduced to Digital  Forensics    <br />
      i.e. courses for  managers/leaders. (Examples: Business school provides instruction on Digital Forensics lab management to  help assure continuity of operations, school of criminal justice introduces  proper measures to secure digital evidence sources, etc.)&nbsp; <br />
